# Sketch

This document contains a sketchpad that we will use to formulate ideas for the 2022 survey.

## How this document is structured

This document is structured, as best as possible, in linear order, using hyperlinks as gotos back or forward if the survey is non-linear in one of the following circumstances:

- different languages have a different order
- certain sections are added, omitted, or modified in a given language
- the survey itself bifrucates at points, leading to different ordering schemes

In general, this document follows the format of the Rust survey, and several parts are taking explicitly from the survey.

All of the text, unless otherwise noted, is assumed to be _universal_ - that is, applicable to all translated languages. If a translator feels that a particular chunk of text (a question, an answer, a rationale) is to English-speaker centric, please put **EN** next to it along with a comment. Similarly, if a clarification or additional text needs to be added for a given language, please put that **JA** or **ZH** next to it.

To regenerate the table of contents for this document, plese use `markdown-toc` and replace the existing table of contents. Do _not_ edit the table of contents by hand!

## PureScript Usage

### Do you use PureScript?

Type: select one

- Yes, I use PureScript (for any purpose, even if you're just learning) [`NEXT`](#your-purescript-experience)
- No, I don't currently use PureScript, but I have in the past [`NEXT`](#for-previous-purescript-users)
- No, I have never used PureScript [`NEXT`](#for-non-purescript-users)

> **justification**
>
> Fundamental for cohort analysis

## For previous PureScript users

### As you have indicated that you're no longer using PureScript, what prompted you to participate in this survey?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- I plan to return to using PureScript in the future
- I consider myself part of the PureScript community
- Specifically to provide feedback on why I stopped using PureScript
- To provide feedback on PureScript in general
- Curiosity
- Other (open response)

> **justification**

> Useful in understanding why non-users contribute;

> **SURVEY FLOW**

> Skip to `## Your opinions about PureScript` section

## For non-PureScript users

### As you have indicated that you have not used PureScript, what prompted you to participate in this survey?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- I plan to use PureScript in the future
- I consider myself part of the PureScript community
- Specifically to provide feedback on WHY I do not use PureScript
- Curiosity

## Your PureScript experience

### On average, how often do you use PureScript?

Type: select one

- Daily or nearly so
- Weekly or nearly so
- Monthly or nearly so
- Rarely

> **justification**
>
> This can be useful demographic information as a proxy for how "important" PureScript is
> in someone's technical life.
>
> We deliberately use calendar time for this question to gauge how "serious" the
> programmer's use of PureScript is. This does mean that we will group together, for example,
> those who program once a week but always in PureScript and those who program daily but
> use PureScript once a week.

### How would you rate your PureScript expertise?

Type: select one

- I can't read or write PureScript
- I can write simple scripts, services, applications or programs in PureScript
- I can write useful, production-ready code but it is a struggle
- I am productive writing PureScript
- I am an expert

> **justification**
>
> Useful for cohort analysis, i.e., for other questions we can query if answers are significantly different for beginners vs advanced users.
>
> Previously this question was a 1-10 ranking. Having specific labels can help with consistency across responses. Additionally, having 10 choices
> was too specific (i.e., what's the difference between a 7 and 8?) where as with the new answers, we have a better idea of what the differences
> between answers actually mean.

### When did you learn to program in PureScript?

**Note**: while you may continue to try to improve your PureScript skills, for this question assume "learning to program in PureScript" means spending the *majority* of your time with PureScript consuming learning materials or coding *in order to learn* (as opposed to achieving some other goal). If your learning process spans several of the listed time periods, pick the one where you felt you learned *the most*.

Type: select one (optional)

- I'm still *actively* trying to learn PureScript
- During 2021
- During 2019 or 2020
- During 2017 or 2018
- During 2015 or 2016
- During 2014 or before

> **justification**
>
> Useful for cohort analysis, i.e., for other questions we can understand if *when* someone learned PureScript impacts their views on things.
>
> The time periods used as answers try to reflect the major "epochs"
> of PureScript history (i.e., pre-0.14, etc) as well as the most
> recent past. We use whole years even though this doesn't line up
> perfectly with these epochs. Learning PureScript in early 2020 was
> likely similar to the experience of learning PureScript post 2019
> while before that the language was changing more rapidly. We explicitly
> use years instead of asking for which PureScript edition someone learned
> because the former is often much easier for respondents to know.
> It's also helpful to be more specific than an edition, and it's fairly
> easy to know which edition someone likely used based on the year they learned PureScript.

### Which operating systems do you use regularly for PureScript development?

**Note**: this is specifically about which systems you use for development *not* all the
systems you target.

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- Linux
- Windows
- Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Mac OS
- Other (open response)

> **justification**
>
> In general we'd like to know which operating systems are most used as dev machines in the community.
>
> We're using "Linux" here rather than grouping all UNIXes together,
> to allow us to gauge interest in specific other UNIXes via the fill-in-the-blank
> "other" option. If we grouped UNIXes together, users of other UNIX systems
> wouldn't be visible; let's try to capture the level of interest in those systems.
> As with many questions with an open "other" response; if any specific answer
> appears frequently, we can add it to future surveys to reduce the amount
> of work needed to process responses.

### What tools do you most frequently use to compile PureScript code? If a tool is used by another tool, please do not check it. _Only_ check it if you use it explicitly (ie by invoking it via the command line).

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- Using the `purescript` Haskell library directly
- `purs`
- `purs-ide` (auto-compilation via an editor)
- `pscid`
- `spago`
- `pulp`

> **justification**
>
> PureScript compilation is increasingly consolidating around `spago` and
> IDE fast rebuild. It'd be good to know if we can more or less drop `pulp` and
> also if there are any bespoke compilation procedures of which we are unaware.

### What output targets do you use?

Type: matrix (optional)

Targets:

- JS via `purs`
- corefn via `purs`
- Erlang via `purerl`
- Go via `purescript-native`
- C++ via `purescript-native`
- Nix via `purescript-nix`
- Python via `purescript-python`

Frequency:
- More frequently than weekly
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Less frequently than monthly
- Never but have tried to
- Never and have never tried to

> **justification**
>
> PureScript has many backends, some of which are stable, some of which are emerging
> and some of which are legacy and no longer maintained.
> We'd like to know how much each one is used.

### What statement below best describes the way you iterate on PureScript code as you develop?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- I periodically compile and verify the results of compilation as I write PureScript code.
- I continuously compile (via `spago watch` or an IDE extension).
- I check and test my work in the PureScript `repl`.
- I continuously verify results via a hot-reload mechanism.
- I push to a CI/CD pipeline that builds a staging environment against which I iterate.
- I write pristine code, push it straight to production, and wait for the occasional bug report.

> **justification**
> By knowing developers' flows when working on PureScript code,
> we can better tweak tooling to meet them where they're at. Also,
> if we see disparities in workflows based on a certain demographic
> index (ie years in the industry, etc), we may be able to make more
> fine-grained recommendations.

### What frameworks do you use for testing PureScript code?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- `jest`
- `mocha`
- `spec`
- `test-unit`
- `quickcheck`

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- `purs`
- `spago`
- `webpack`

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- `halogen`
- `react-basic`

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- `httpure`
- `payload`
- `hyper`

> **justification**
> This will help us establish baselines for usage of backend frameworks, etc.

### What packages, if any, do you use from the FFI (ie react, vue, puppeteer etc)

Type: free form (optional)

### Which platforms, operating systems or runtimes do you develop PureScript software for?

**Note**: this is specifically about which platform, operating system or runtime you **target** not which system you use
for development nor which specific architectures (e.g., x86 vs ARM) you target.

- iOS
- Android
- Embedded platforms (with an operating system)
- Embedded platforms (bare metal)

> **justification**
>
> This question can be used to figure out roughly what systems are being targeted as well as
> what OS stack is being developed against (i.e., desktop/server OS, mobile OS, embedded OS, bare metal)
>
> We're using "Linux" here rather than "*nix" or similar, with the same
> justification as in the "Which operating systems do you use" question.
>
> We specifically care about the runtime environment being targeted.

- A tool I use requires it
- Other (open response)

> **justification**
>
> We'd like to know what are the common reasons people use nightly
> so that we can better understand where testers are coming from.

### If you use a custom fork of the compiler, why?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- I don't use any custom fork
- Out of habit
- For a particular language feature or set of language features I need
- I like to have access to all the latest features
- To help test the compiler and report bugs
- For testing in CI
- A library I use requires it
- A tool I use requires it
- Other (open response)

> **justification**
>

> can change investment strategies for further IDE development.
>
> Note: previously this question included different 'drivers' of the PureScript IDE
> experience (e.g., racer, rls, purescript-analyzer). Development has consolidated on
> purescript-analyzer, and so it's not necessary to find out which is being used.
> If we are curious how far along adoption of purescript-analyzer is, we can ask that
> in a separate question, though this is likely easier to find out through download
> numbers.

> **justification**
>
> It is good to know how many users use a debugging tool, and which tool they use.
> This information could influence priorities for the compiler and tools teams.
>
> Note that there is some overlap between the answers, e.g., VS Code uses either a
> GDB or LLDB plugin, but I think that is OK, we can take this into account when
> interpreting the answers and we will get an indication of user's perceptions of
> their tools.

## About you

See [who](./design/who.md).

The following are primarily for cohort analysis, secondarily for understanding the shape of the community.

For methodological purposes, the bulk of the demographics should be at the end of the survey (unless acting as filter/flow questions above).
They're both easy to complete (beneficial at the end) and somewhat personal (but at this point folks are invested and we've built 'tpurescript').
Can also be problematic at start if we're asking all easy, personal questions and then get to the harder ones - easy to drop out.

### Excluding PureScript, what is your experience with other kinds of programming languages?

Type: matrix (optional)

Languages:

- Assembly language (of any variety)
- Languages with manual memory management (e.g., C, C++, Objective-C without ARC)
- Statically typed object oriented languages with garbage collection (e.g., Java, C#, Go)
- Statically typed functional programming languages (e.g., Haskell, ML)
- Dynamically typed functional programming languages (e.g., Lisp, Clojure, Elixir)
- Statically typed languages with newer expressive type systems (e.g., Swift, Kotlin, Scala)
- Dynamically typed languages (e.g., Javascript, Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl)

Experience:

- I've never used nor am I familiar with any language in this category
- I have a basic familiarity with at least one language in this category
- I am comfortable using at least one language in this category
- I am an expert in at least one language in this category
