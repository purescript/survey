# Survey questions

Whether or not you use Rust Programming Language <https://rust-lang.org> today, we want to hear from you!

The Rust Community Team has created this survey to help us gauge how we're doing, what can be improved, and how we can best engage with all of you as we move forward.

This is your chance to have a say in the development priorities for Rust.

Unless you choose to enter your email, your answers will be anonymous. Any personal data you submit as a part of this survey will be handled in accordance with our policy as described in our Frequently Asked Questions:

https://github.com/rust-community/team/wiki/State-of-the-Rust-Language-Community-Survey-FAQ

We estimate it will take about 10-25 minutes to complete.

## Rust Usage

### Do you use Rust?

Type: select one

- Yes, I use Rust (for any purpose, even if you're just learning) [`NEXT`](#your-rust-experience)
- No, I don't currently use Rust, but I have in the past [`NEXT`](#for-previous-rust-users)
- No, I have never used Rust [`NEXT`](#for-non-rust-users)

> **justification**

> Fundamental for cohort analysis

## For previous Rust users

### As you have indicated that you're no longer using Rust, what prompted you to participate in this survey?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- I plan to return to using Rust in the future
- I consider myself part of the Rust community
- Specifically to provide feedback on why I stopped using Rust
- To provide feedback on Rust in general
- Curiosity
- Other (open response)

## For non-Rust users

### As you have indicated that you have not used Rust, what prompted you to participate in this survey?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- I plan to use Rust in the future
- I consider myself part of the Rust community
- Specifically to provide feedback on WHY I do not use Rust
- Curiosity

## Your Rust experience

### On average, how often do you use Rust?

Type: select one

- Daily or nearly so
- Weekly or nearly so
- Monthly or nearly so
- Rarely

> **justification**
>
> This can be useful demographic information as a proxy for how "important" Rust is
> in someone's technical life.
>
> We deliberately use calendar time for this question to gauge how "serious" the
> programmer's use of Rust is. This does mean that we will group together, for example,
> those who program once a week but always in Rust and those who program daily but
> use Rust once a week.

### How would you rate your Rust expertise?

Type: select one

- I can't read or write Rust
- I can write simple programs in Rust
- I can write useful, production-ready code but it is a struggle
- I am productive writing Rust
- I am an expert

> **justification**
>
> Useful for cohort analysis, i.e., for other questions we can query if answers are significantly different for beginners vs advanced users.
>
> Previously this question was a 1-10 ranking. Having specific labels can help with consistency across responses. Additionally, having 10 choices
> was too specific (i.e., what's the difference between a 7 and 8?) where as with the new answers, we have a better idea of what the differences 
> between answers actually mean.

### When did you learn to program in Rust?

**Note**: while you may continue to try to improve your Rust skills, for this question assume "learning to program in Rust"
means spending the *majority* of your time with Rust consuming learning materials or coding *in order to learn* (as opposed to achieving
some other goal). If your learning process spans several of the listed time periods, pick the one where you felt you learned *the most*.

Type: select one (optional)

- I'm still *actively* trying to learn Rust
- During 2021
- During 2019 or 2020
- During 2017 or 2018
- During 2015 or 2016
- During 2014 or before

> **justification**
>
> Useful for cohort analysis, i.e., for other questions we can understand if *when* someone learned Rust impacts their views on things.
>
> The time periods used as answers try to reflect the major "epochs" of Rust history (i.e., pre-1.0, 2015 edition pre and post new error style,
> and 2018 edition) as well as the most recent past. We use whole years even though this doesn't line up perfectly with these epochs. Learning
> Rust in early 2015 was likely similar to the experience of learning Rust post 1.0 while before that the language was changing rapidly.
> We explicitly use years instead of asking for which Rust edition someone learned because the former is often much easier for respondents to know.
> It's also helpful to be more specific than an edition, and it's fairly easy to know which edition someone likely used based on the year they
> learned Rust.

### Which operating systems do you use regularly for Rust development?

**Note**: this is specifically about which systems you use for development *not* all the 
systems you target.

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- Linux
- Windows
- Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Mac OS
- Other (open response)

> **justification**
>
> In general we'd like to know which operating systems are most used as dev machines in the community.
>
> We're using "Linux" here rather than grouping all UNIXes together, to allow
> us to gauge interest in specific other UNIXes via the fill-in-the-blank
> "other" option. If we grouped UNIXes together, users of other UNIX systems
> wouldn't be visible; let's try to capture the level of interest in those
> systems. As with many questions with an open "other" response; if any
> specific answer appears frequently, we can add it to future surveys to reduce
> the amount of work needed to process responses.

### On the primary machine you compile Rust code on, how many CPUs are there?

Please count *logical* CPUs here, not cores or sockets. You can get this number by running the following commands from the command line:

- Linux: `nproc`
- macOS: `sysctl -n hw.ncpu`
- Windows Command Prompt: `echo %NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%`
- Windows PowerShell: `(Get-CimInstance Win32_ComputerSystem).NumberOfLogicalProcessors`

Type: free form (number, optional)

> **justification**
>
> Question added by Josh Triplett. The answers can help tune parallel rustc:
>
> - When we encounter a scalability issue that starts at a certain number of CPUs, it'll be good to know what proportion of the Rust community is affected.
> - It'll help when tuning algorithms or build systems whose memory usage may depend on the number of CPUs present.
> - It'll help with prioritization around whether to make something go faster by throwing more CPUs at it or by optimizing on the same number of CPUs.
> - It'll help avoid assumptions that rust developers might otherwise make about how universal the caliber of hardware they have is.

### Which operating systems or runtimes do you develop Rust software for?

**Note**: this is specifically about which operating system or runtime you **target** not which system you use
for development nor which specific architectures (e.g., x86 vs ARM) you target.

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- Linux (desktop or server)
- Windows
- Mac OS
- iOS
- Android
- Embedded platforms (with an operating system)
- Embedded platforms (bare metal)
- WebAssembly
- Explicitly platform-independent (e.g., a library which does not interact with the operating system)
- Other (open response)

> **justification**
>
> This question can be used to figure out roughly what systems are being targeted as well as 
> what OS stack is being developed against (i.e., desktop/server OS, mobile OS, embedded OS, bare metal)
>
> We're using "Linux" here rather than "*nix" or similar, with the same
> justification as in the "Which operating systems do you use" question.
>
> We specifically care about the runtime environment being targeted. ISA and other machine specifics are
> not what matters.

### Which version(s) of Rust do you use for local development?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- A specific version of stable Rust older than 1.47
- Beta release
- Latest nightly

- Custom fork
- I don't know
- Other (open response)

> **justification**
>
> Together with the following question, we can better determine what the spread of 
> version usage is across the community.
> We ask specifically about version 1.47 since it is, at the time of the survey, the 
> version that was released ~1 year prior. Additionally, at the time of this writing
> all major Linux distros have a version equal to or newer than this version.

### Which version(s) of Rust do you use in automated testing (e.g., CI)?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

REPEAT

- A tool I use requires it
- Other (open response)

> **justification**
>
> We'd like to know what are the common reasons people use nightly
> so that we can better understand where testers are coming from.

### If you use beta, why?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- I don't use beta
- Out of habit
- To adopt stabilized language features as early as possible
- To help test the beta version for bugs

> **justification**
>
> It is good to know which editor is the most preferred for Rust development. This
> can change investment strategies for further IDE development.
>
> Note: previously this question included different 'drivers' of the Rust IDE
> experience (e.g., racer, rls, rust-analyzer). Development has consolidated on
> rust-analyzer, and so it's not necessary to find out which is being used.
> If we are curious how far along adoption of rust-analyzer is, we can ask that
> in a separate question, though this is likely easier to find out through download
> numbers.

- Other (open response)

> **justification**
>
> It is good to know how many users use a debugging tool, and which tool they use.
> This information could influence priorities for the compiler and tools teams.
>
> Note that there is some overlap between the answers, e.g., VS Code uses either a
> GDB or LLDB plugin, but I think that is OK, we can take this into account when
> interpreting the answers and we will get an indication of user's perceptions of
> their tools.

## About you

See [who](./design/who.md).

The following are primarily for cohort analysis, secondarily for understanding the shape of the community.

For methodological purposes, the bulk of the demographics should be at the end of the survey (unless acting as filter/flow questions above).
They're both easy to complete (beneficial at the end) and somewhat personal (but at this point folks are invested and we've built 'trust').
Can also be problematic at start if we're asking all easy, personal questions and then get to the harder ones - easy to drop out.

### Do you consider yourself a member of a group which is underrepresented or marginalized in technology?

Please share only what you are comfortable sharing. This will help us better serve underrepresented and marginalized groups, better understand how well our outreach efforts are going, and more.

Type: select one

- Yes
- No [`NEXT`](#are-you-a-full--or-part-time-student)

### Excluding Rust, what is your experience with other kinds of programming languages?

Type: matrix (optional)

Languages:

- Assembly language (of any variety)
- Languages with manual memory management (e.g., C, C++, Objective-C without ARC)
- Statically typed object oriented languages with garbage collection (e.g., Java, C#, Go)
- Statically typed functional programming languages (e.g., Haskell, ML)
- Dynamically typed functional programming languages (e.g., Lisp, Clojure, Elixir)
- Statically typed languages with newer expressive type systems (e.g., Swift, Kotlin, Scala)
- Dynamically typed languages (e.g., Javascript, Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl)

- I have a basic familiarity with at least one language in this category
- I am comfortable using at least one language in this category
- I am an expert in at least one language in this category

- I feel comfortable and capable of consuming a written technical educational material (e.g., technical books, blog posts, etc.) in English

> **justification**
>
> We want to understand self reported feeling of comfort and capability of communication
> of English since a large portion of the Rust community is and likely will always be in English.

### What is/are your preferred language(s) for technical communication?

**IMPORTANT**: Your answer should reflect your **preference** and **not** what you are capable of communicating in. For example, if you feel comfortable and capable of consuming technical communication in both English and Korean, but you always prefer Korean, you should *only* answer Korean as that is your preference.

## Anything else?

### Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?

Type: free form (optional)

> **justification**
>
> While it's unlikely we'll receive any one piece of feedback from this question that will prove to be super useful, 
> having it in the survey can still be useful. It can help us decide on new questions or perspectives that we want to
> try to capture in future surveys. It also gives respondents a place to give thanks or share a particular opinion they
> hold which can be useful in and of itself.
