# Survey meeting :: 08-12-2021

- Present: @mikesol @kayhide
- The purpose of the survey is to assess how developers build & ship PS apps/services (or, if they're not using PS, why not).
- Proposed workflow:
  - Mike will put together a PR on GitHub that acts as our scratchpad. We can make proposals to the document directly in the PR and approve/reject the proposals. We'll merge the PR once the scratchpad accurately specifies what the survey will look like for all of the languages.
  - This document should be finished no later than **January 15**.
  - At that point, @mikesol, @kayhide and @tao will use the document to make the actual survey on Survey Hero. We chose Survey Hero over other similar tools because has a good history of making surveys available to a Chinese audience.
  - The survey should be fully translated into English, Japanese and Mandarin by **February 15**.
  - The goal is to ship the survey by **March 1**.
- Translators, if possible, can also help diffusing the survey to local audiences. For example, in Japan, there are some Japanese-language Slack groups that would be a good place to post the survey announcement.

Those are the only minutes for the meeting. If there are any questions/concerns/clarifications/ideas to add, please add them to this document in a PR. If there are any issues that arise from the minutes (ie questions about the goals themselves, the timeline, etc) please open them as GH issues. Thanks!
